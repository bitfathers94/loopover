// Guards against a silently dead EXPORT (#9852) — the gap check-dead-source-files.ts names in its own header:
//
//   > DELIBERATELY NARROW. This is not a general dead-code/knip-style analysis (no re-export chasing, no
//   > detection of a file that's imported but whose EXPORTS are all unused)
//
// That gap was populated: 87 `src/**` symbols were exported and referenced nowhere outside the file that
// declared them — not by another module, not by a script, not even by their own test. Each one is one of
// three things, and nothing told them apart:
//
//   1. A missing wire-up — #9492's class one level down. An export with no caller is a feature that was
//      built and never connected.
//   2. A safety net with nothing behind it — #9851 exactly: two route-spec tables exported "for the
//      meta-test that asserts every entry's declared auth matches the middleware", test never written.
//   3. Genuinely dead surface that still has to be read, typechecked and maintained.
//
// Coverage cannot catch any of them: the declaring file's own tests exercise the symbol directly and report
// green while it contributes nothing to the running system.
//
// THE FIX IS USUALLY NOT DELETION. Most flagged symbols are used inside their own file — the export keyword
// is the only untrue part. Dropping `export` makes the surface honest and is provably safe (tsc fails if the
// symbol really was reached from elsewhere). Deletion is for a symbol with no uses at all.
//
// DELIBERATELY TEXTUAL, matching its sibling: identifier occurrences, not a TypeScript program. A symbol
// reached only through a namespace import (`import * as m`) or a dynamic string would be a false positive —
// which is what ALLOWED_EXPORTS is for, and why it demands a reason rather than a bare name.
