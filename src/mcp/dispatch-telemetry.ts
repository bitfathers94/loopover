// The remote server's tool-dispatch telemetry chokepoint (#9525).
//
// Every `tools/call` the remote server answers passes through `instrumentToolDispatch` exactly
// once, whether it returns, returns an error envelope, or throws. That is the whole point of a
// chokepoint: ~116 handlers stay untouched, and there is one place where the decision "what does a
// tool call emit" is made.
//
// WHAT IT EMITS, all of it defined in @loopover/contract so the three servers cannot drift:
//   - the minimal `usage_event` (tool, category, surface, ok, duration, closed error code);
//   - PostHog's `$mcp_tool_call`, which additionally carries REDACTED, size-capped arguments and
//     results -- except for tools the contract marks as carrying operator data, where both are
//     excluded outright and the event says so;
//   - a `$exception` capture for a genuine throw (an error ENVELOPE is a tool answering, not a
//     crash, and is not an exception);
//   - an OTel span `mcp.tool/<name>` on the self-host path, whose attributes are a strict subset --
//     never arguments.
//
// SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION: every sink is gated and best-effort, and this wrapper catches everything it
// does. Telemetry must never turn a working tool call into a failed one.
