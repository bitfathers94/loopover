// The remote server's PostHog + OTel sink for dispatch telemetry (#9525).
//
// Separated from the wrapper in dispatch-telemetry.ts so the decision logic stays pure and testable
// while this file owns the I/O and the gates. Both events, the exception capture, and the span all
// go through here.
//
// GATES ARE UNCHANGED by this issue: the usage events keep POSTHOG_API_KEY (#6228/#6235), the
// exception capture keeps WORKER_POSTHOG_API_KEY (#8288). Those two are deliberately separate --
// src/api/worker-posthog.ts explains why at length -- and #9525 does not merge them, because doing
// so would silently activate Worker exception capture inside a self-hoster's Node process the
// moment they set the MCP telemetry key.
//
// posthog-node rather than a hand-built $exception payload: PostHog's own docs warn that a
// hand-constructed exception event "fails in the vast majority of cases because the exception event
// schema is strict", and this Worker already bundles posthog-node for #6235, so there is no bundle
// argument for avoiding it here. (#9525's issue text assumed metagraphed's situation, where the
// bundle cost was real.)
